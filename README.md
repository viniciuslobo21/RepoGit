## Used Technologies

The code is organized using a Clean Architecture with MVVM architecture for the presentation layer. The implementation was heavily based
on the articles and projects of Fernando Cejas:

 * Article: https://fernandocejas.com/2018/05/07/architecting-android-reloaded/
 * Project: https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture-Kotlin
 
 Other than that, i've used some technologies, like:
  * <b>Koin</b> for dependency injection
  * <b>Coroutines</b> for async tasks
  * <b>Junit</b> with <b>MockK</b> for unit tests
  * <b>Retrofit</b> for REST API calls
